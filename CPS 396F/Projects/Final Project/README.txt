Location based Notes and Reminders.

Team members: Nicholas Garnder, Chris Phillips.

Developer Description:
	The Location based Notes and Reminders app uses the devices location to send notifications based on 
	user made Notes and Reminders. The Notes and Reminders will have a title, discription, and a location 
	associated with them. The user is able to create, update, and delete Notes or Reminders as they want.
	The notes are stored locally on the device using Gson to write a file in JSON. We felt their was no need
	to implement a database storage for the app because the Notes and Reminders won't really be holding any
	sensitive data that needs to be backed up. 


API's Used:
	Google Maps API
	AnkoLogger API
	Google Location Services API
	Gson API
